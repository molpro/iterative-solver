Welcome to LinearAlgebra
========================

LinearAlgebra is a part of Molpro's ecosystem.
It implements iterative solvers for linear and non-linear problems and
distributed arrays for HPC.
The solvers are specialised to work with specific data types, but are also
templated on the container allowing for easy integration into existing software.

This library is under active development and potential collaborators are welcome to contact
Prof. Peter Knowles at Cardiff University.
