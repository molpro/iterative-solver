/*!
 * @brief Manages opening/closing HDF5 files and groups.
 *
 * Motivation
 * ----------
 * When writing functions or classes that need to write to an hdf5 file there are many ways to pass that information.
 * The user might only have the file name and group name and pass them as strings. Or they could have an hdf5 file
 * object and a group string, or and hdf5 group object, but was the file open with a correct access type or does the
 * group object correspond to a valid file? Does the user want the hdf5 objects to be closed after use?
 *
 * One needs to make multiple constructors and function overloads to ensure the users are kept happy and the procedure
 * might need to be repeated for different classes. The purpose of HDF5Handle is to implement this in one place and let
 * the handle manage opening and closing of hdf5 objects, checking access type and more.
 *
 * Concepts
 * --------
 *   - assignment: handle stores the information about the object
 *   - ownership: handle can open and close the hdf5 objects
 *
 * A file and/or group can be assigned to the handle by passing corresponding file path or group path as a string,
 * or directly providing the relevant hdf5 object.
 * There can only be one file and group assigned to the handle at any one time.
 *
 * Assignment of a file is permanent for each handle, however groups can be re-assigned. Assigning a new
 * group automatically closes the old one, since there can only be one file and group per handle.
 *
 * If the assignment is done by passing strings than the handle takes ownership of the hdf5 objects and
 * can open and close the file and/or group.
 * Opening is done by calling open_file()/open_group(), and closing can be done either through
 * close_file()/close_group() or by the destructor.
 *
 * The assignment can be done by passing the hid in which case the user can transfer ownership of the underlying
 * hdf5 object allowing handle to close it, or they can keep ownership to themselves thus keeping responsibility
 * for closing the object when it is not needed.
 *
 * Examples
 * ---------
 * Use a file handle to store arrays in different groups:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * auto h = HDF5Handle(file_name);
 * h.open_file(HDF5Handle::Access::read_write);
 * for (auto & a: arrays){
 *   h.open_group(get_new_group_name()); // reassigning closes the previous group
 *   store_in_new_group(h.group_id(), a);
 * }
 * h.close_file(); // Or let the destructor do it
 * @endcode
 *
 * Use as an argument in a function that needs a group id
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Without a handle we might need multiple overloads, and perform many checks for validity of the object
 * void write_to_group(std::string file_name, std::string group_name);
 * void write_to_group(hid_t group_id);
 *
 * // Instead we can just take a handle
 * void write_to_group(HDF5Handle& handle){
 *   write_to_group(handle.open_group());
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 *

  /*!
   * @brief Create a handle from an already open hdf5 file or group with option to transfer ownership
   *
   * Only one hdf5 object can be assigned. If it is a file object, than later calls to open_group() can assign
   * a group with ownership making sure that it can be closed.
   * Assigning a group object implies assignment of the overlying file with the same ownership.
   * If the ownership is not transferred than the overlying hdf5 file object must remain open.
   * Furthermore, opening a file that does not contain a group object is erroneous.
   *
   * File name containing the hdf5 object is always stored, and if it is a group object than group name is also stored.
   *
   * The handle will be in a dummy state in the following cases:
   *   - hid object is not valid (see H5Iis_valid)
   *   - hid object does not correspond to a file or a group
